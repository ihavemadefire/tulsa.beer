## Tulsa.Beer Loves Tulsa beer

Tulsa.beer is an api powered django application as a hub for all things Tulsa Brew Culture.

Tulsa.Beeer uses both dynamic routing and jquery ajax calls to the internal API to dynamically populat the pages

### Using the application in beta (pre-deploy)

Clone the repo to your local machine, navigate inside the top level directory for the project.

Make sure you have Django installed on your local machine by running

`pip3 install Django`

then run

`python3 manage.py runserver`

then open the test server on 127.0.0.1:8000

Then enjoy!

I would like to see  this project grow into something more in the long run.
